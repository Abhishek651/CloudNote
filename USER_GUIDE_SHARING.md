## How Share Links Work

### For the Sender
- When you share a note or folder, a unique link is generated
- Example: `https://cloudxnote.vercel.app/share/note/abc123xyz`
- This link never expires (unless you remove the item from global)
- You can copy the link anytime from the Global page

### For the Receiver
1. **Click the share link** you received
2. If not logged in, you'll see a message:
   - "This note/folder is shared with you, but you need to sign in or create an account to view it"
3. **Click "Sign In / Sign Up"**
4. After logging in, you're automatically redirected to the shared content
5. You can now view the note or explore the folder

## Real-Time Updates

### Automatic Syncing
When you update a note or folder that's shared globally:
- **Changes sync automatically** to the global version
- **No manual action needed** - it happens in the background
- **Recipients always see the latest version**

### What Gets Synced
